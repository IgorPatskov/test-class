Show them to me, show them to me
Unclasp your bra and set those puppies free
They'd look a whole lot better without that sweater baby I'm sure you'll agree
If you got, two fun bags,
Show them to me

All the world will live in harmony
It'll do you good, it'll give me wood, we'll make history
If you love your country, I'm gonna say it one more time,
I said if you love your country yeah
Then stand your ass up and show them big old titties to me
